# Expo ImagePicker Corrupted URI Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Expo's ImagePicker with a custom camera implementation.  The ImagePicker returns an URI that is unable to be displayed or processed correctly.

## Bug Description

When selecting an image using a custom camera integration, the URI provided by ImagePicker is corrupted. This prevents the application from loading the image. The issue is specific to custom camera implementations and does not occur when using the default camera provided by ImagePicker.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the application on a physical device or emulator.
4. Select an image using the custom camera.
5. Observe the error that prevents the image from displaying correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the URI validity before attempting to process the image.  We should check the URI structure, file existence, and data integrity before proceeding.
